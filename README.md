# vmie-lambda
Lambda function that works off of a S3 Create Object Event that will import a VMDK file to a AMI. This is a simple Lambda function that will take a single VMDK file and import it to a AMI using the VM Import\Export Service. I will add more documentation around the how to create the trigger and a Lambda Package.
